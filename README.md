Once logged in, users can join existing classes by entering a class code or create new classes. Each class has a unique ID and a subtitle that helps users identify it.

### Project Management

Within a class, users can create new projects, specifying the project title, description, and group members. Users can also view and manage existing projects, including adding or removing members.

### Team Collaboration

Team members can collaborate on projects by sharing their skills and interests. The platform provides a way to list and view team members' skills and interests, facilitating better collaboration.

### Messaging

The integrated messaging system allows users to communicate with each other. Users can send and receive messages, helping them stay connected and coordinate their efforts.

### Profile Management

Users can manage their profiles, including updating their skills, interests, and availability. This information is visible to other team members, helping them understand each other's strengths and availability.
